# For Jordan

## Introduction

This is a Github Pages project that I developed for my girlfriend Jordan, she is wonderful and deserves this.
It was very fun, and I hope she enjoys it. If you have a girlfriend in need of a valentines gift, have at it. 
(I will be unaware of your sins, but you will always remember >:) )

## Development

It's nothing special, just some quick CSS and HTML Development. I developed a JS snake game before, and just re-used and updated that code
I developed the JS for the Yes/No buttons myself, and they're still pretty simple.
For the animated background on the Index page, I used Vanta.js. I used their clouds variation.
I utilized a simple understanding of JS, CSS, and HTML. I added code comments where I deemed necessary, feel free to add more to your own rendition of this.

## Installation

As I mentioned above, to use an animated background like that, i'd look at Vanta.js, and see all of their options. I also recommend using three.js, links below.

On top of those, you need a development environment capable of coding in
 - HTML
 - Javascript
 - CSS
 I used Visual Studio Code!

Have fun!
