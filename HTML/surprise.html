    <h1>Dear Charlotte,</h1>
    <p>
      I wanted to take a moment to let you know how much you mean to me. You bring so much joy and light into my life, more than I can put into words. 
      Even though I’m feeling under the weather right now, thinking of you makes everything brighter. 
      Your smile, your kindness, and the way you care about others are truly special, and I am so grateful to have you in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I could be with you right now, but until then, I hope this little note brings a smile to your face, just like you always do for me. 
      Thank you for being you, Charlotte. You are amazing, and I can’t wait to see you soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sending you all my love and a big hug,
      <br>
      Lorenzo
