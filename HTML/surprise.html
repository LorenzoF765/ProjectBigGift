    <h1>Dear Kirsten,</h1>
    <p>
      I want you to know how much you mean to me. You bring so much joy and light into my life, more than I can put into words. 
      Thinking of you makes everything brighter, hence why you're always on the dome. 
      Your smile, your kindness, and the way you care about others are truly special, and I am so lucky to have you in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I could be with you right this second, but until then, I hope this little ditty (NOT diddy) brings a smile to your face, just like you always do for me. 
      Thank you for being you, Kir. You are amazing, and I canâ€™t wait to see you later today, or tomorrow if you aren't reading this today.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you know just how loved you are,
      <br>
      Lorenzo
